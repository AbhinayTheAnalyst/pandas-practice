# 📌 Introduction to Pandas
# ----------------------------------------
# Pandas is a powerful Python library used for:
# → Handling tabular data (like Excel/CSV files)
# → Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
# → Making sense of structured data (rows & columns)
# ----------------------------------------
# Think of Pandas as Excel + Python power together 💪

# 🔽 Let's import the library first
import pandas as pd

# ✅ Creating a simple DataFrame (like a table)
data = {
    'Name': ['Abhinay', 'Radha', 'Sita', 'Rohan'],
    'Age': [21, 25, 22, 23],
    'City': ['Patna', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Kolkata']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
         |
      #Dataframe is 2D table that gives data in rows and columns like Excel gives OUTPUT LIKE WRITTEN BELOW 👇 

    Name	 Age	 Class

  0 Abhinay	18	12th
  1 Radha	17	11th
  2  Sita	19	12th

# 📊 Display the data
print("🔹 Sample DataFrame:")
print(df)

# ✅ Check basic info about the dataset
print("\n🔍 Info of DataFrame:")
print(df.info())

# ✅ Check summary stats (if numerical data)
print("\n📈 Summary Stats:")
print(df.describe()) #it gives you all calculation eg.mean, median,%...etc..
